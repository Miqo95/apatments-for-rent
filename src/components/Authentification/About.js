          Tumanyan Shawarma was founded in 1998:
        </h3>
        <p>
          The first branch operated at the intersection of Tumanyan and Abovyan
          streetsâ€¤
        </p>
        <p>
          After a short time, becoming a favorite place of Yerevan residents,
          there was a need to expand.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2013, the second branch of "Tumanyan Shawarma" was opened in the
          Arabkir administrative district, at Komitas 50/50.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2015, the "Grand buffet" opened on the second floor of the branch
          at 32 Tumanyan street, where salads, soups and other hot snacks are
          served.
        </p>
        <p>
          Staying true to the expansion strategy, in 2018, the fast food chain
          Tumanyan Shawarma opened another branch in the Davtashen
          administrative district.
        </p>
        <p style={{ paddingBottom: "40px" }}>
          Fast food chain "Tumanyan Shawarma" will continue its development
          program, opening new branches and constantly updating the menu.
